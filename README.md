# Gitpocalypse
_A workbook for practicing and solving git-ssues_

## Welcome!

This repo is intended to serve as a tutorial and a workbench to do all the
insane merge commit tests you were afraid to do on your own projet.

Here, it doesn't matter if you break it - *it's meand to be broken*.

The first thing you'll want (if you don't have one already) is a Github profile.

The next think you'll want is to make sure you got git.

Finally, once those are out of the way...

## How to use this hot mess as a workbench

Fork it and start messin' around. Done.

## How to use this as a tutorial

Using Github:

Click the Fork button to copy the entire repository to your repositories.

Then, either download the zip file by clicking download
[insert image here]
and unzip it where you want it to live (probably not your downloads folder)

#### OR
Clone the repository from your terminal.

Copy-paste the HTTP link by clicking on the download button:
[insert image here]

Then, run the command:

##### MacOS
```git clone <copy-pasted url> ``` 

Now you have the repo!

The two most important branches are master and Workshop. Master and Workshop
are identical, and mirror a common convention in professional apps - do your
work in Workshop (a development or staging branch) and keep Master around in
case you need to revert, and sync them only when you've finalized changes (if
you want).

The repo contains lots of branches - most to practice specific commands or solve
problems - but feel free to make your own! Use this repo to replicate your
current problem and fine-tune your solution so you don't loose hours of work, or
to level up your applied Gitology.
